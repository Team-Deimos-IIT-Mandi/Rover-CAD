A comprehensive CAD model of a rover, designed for exploration and remote operation. This repository contains all the necessary files to view, modify, and simulate the rover's mechanics.

## üìú Description

This project is a detailed CAD model of a rover. The design is modular, allowing for easy customization and addition of new components. The primary goal of this project is to provide a platform for educational purposes, and for hobbyists to build their own rover.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Modular Design**: Easily add or remove components.
* **Detailed Components**: High-fidelity models of all parts.
* **Simulation-Ready**: The model can be used in various simulation environments.
* **3D Printable**: Many parts are designed to be 3D printable.

## üìÇ CAD Files

The CAD files are located in the `CAD/` directory. The main assembly file is `rover.iam`. The following file formats are provided:

* `.iam` (Autodesk Inventor Assembly)
* `.ipt` (Autodesl Inventor Part)
* `.step` (Standard for the Exchange of Product model data)
* `.stl` (STereoLithography)
